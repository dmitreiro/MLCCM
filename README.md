## Background
### Purpose
Based on previous scientific researches (see [bibliography](#bibliography)), this project aims to study Abaqus simulation data interpolation into well defined and equally spaced mesh grid points.

### Why data interpolation into mesh grid?

### Brief introduction to interpolation
<!-- methods and theory, python libraries used and why, ... -->

### Choosed interpolation methods and grids

### Which one should I choose?
<!-- "re-interpolation" back to integration points -->
<!-- predicted vs original parameter comparison -->
<!-- global statistics and analysis -->
